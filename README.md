## Students
Pre-university students ages 13 to 17 are invited to take part in Google Code-in: Our global, online contest introducing teenagers to the world of open source development. With a wide variety of bite-sized tasks, it’s easy for beginners to jump in and get started no matter what skills they have.

Mentors from our participating organizations lend a helping hand as participants learn what it’s like to work on an open source project. Participants get to work on real software and win prizes from t-shirts to a trip to Google HQ!

## Open Source Mentoring Organizations
Open source organizations are selected by Google based on their success mentoring students in Google Summer of Code. These organizations are devoted to guiding students and giving them an introduction to open source software development.

## [Roles and Responsibilities](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/help/responsibilities)

There are always a lot of questions about what the expectations are for each role in the GCI and GSoC programs. Organizations have developed their own, and this has resulted in wide variation. This documentation aims to standardize expectations across all participating organizations.
